## Deployment on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Push this code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to Vercel and import the project.
3. It will automatically detect Next.js and deploy.

Alternatively, if you have the Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
vercel
```
